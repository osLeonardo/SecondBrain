Okay, below is an outline of car parts and their specific effects on racing.
While the game does indeed tell you, some players might not understand. I
have marked the 'best' option with a *.


EXHAUST         -----------------------------------
   Sports - Almost not worth it, just go with Racing
   Semi-Racing - Almost not worth it, just go with Racing
   Racing - A Boost in engine performance, slight speed/accel boost *


DRIVETRAIN      -----------------------------------
   Transmission
      Close - More Acceleration, a bit less top speed
      Super-Close - Even more Accel, even less top speed
      Full Customize - Allows you to Tweak the Gear Ratio's yourself *
   
   Clutch
      Sports - Seems to enhance gear-switch performance 
      Twin-wheel - Generically better then a Sports
      Tripple-Plate - Best Option, has the most benefit. *

   Flywheel
      Sports - Also enhances gear-switch time. 
      Semi-Racing - A Step up from Sports
      Racing - And your best Option. Buy this one. *

   Limited Slip
      1-way - Improves accel/ - meant to help you come out of corners better
      1.5-way - Improves accel/decel - meant to help cornering
      2-way - Improves accel/decel fully - helps with cornering
      Full Customize - Allows you to tweak how the car turns. *

   AYC Controller - Lets you turn better at higher speeds. *

   Carbon Driveshaft - Less Weight - more Accel. *


TIRES           -----------------------------------
   Standard Tires (go with sports if possible)
      Economy - Avoid these if possible
      Comfort - Avoid these if possible
      Road - Your best option unless sports are allowed.

   Sports Tires (a lot of races only allow sports, but go racing if possible)
      Hard - Low Grip, but last the longest
      Medium - Medium Grip, last for a good 5 laps or so
      Soft - High Grip, but they will die quick, so youll have to pit often.

   Racing Tires (best option for tires, if permitted) *
      R1 - Basically, if Racing tires are allowed, you want to gauge this
      R2 - entirely by how many laps there are. If there are only 2-3 laps
      R3 - then go between R3 and R5, if there are a lot of laps, then go
      R4 - between R3 and R1.
      R5 - (read above)

   Dirt/Snow Tires - These let you race in dirt or Snow with your car.


BRAKES          -----------------------------------
   Racing Brakes - Lets you brake a bit faster, and retain more control. *

   Brake Controller - lets you tweak the balance between front and rear
                      braking. *


TURBO           -----------------------------------
   Turbine Kit - (as you go up the scale you get faster, but loose turning)
      S1 - Boosts speed and accel slightly (helps manueverability)
      S2 - Boosts speed and accel a bit more (a fine balance)
      S3 - Strong boost to speed and accel (geared toward peak power)
      S4 - Huge boost to speed and accel (High speed courses are recomended)

   Intercooler - Buy one if you have a Turbine Kit
      Sports - Makes the Turbine Kit perform even better
      Racing - Maximizes the Turbine Kits potential *

   Supercharger - Large boost to Acceleration Speed, especially in the 
                  low/mid range. *


ENGINE          -----------------------------------
   NA Tuning - One of the best ways to make your car just go a bit faster.
      S1 - Small Accel/Speed Boost.
      S2 - Accel/Speed Boost.
      S3 - Best Accel/Speed Boost. *

   Port Polish - Engine Care, slight HP Boost

   Engine Balancing - Engine Care, Slight HP Boost

   Displacement UP - Havent toyed with yet - supposedly increases Accel

   Racing Chip - Gears car for racing, best bang-for-buck HP boost.

   Nitrous - Hold R1 to use this while racing, Hooray for Nitrous! This will
             obviously boost your speed even when redlining.


SUSPENSION      -----------------------------------
   Suspension
      sports - Can modify some options.
      Semi-Racing - can modify more options.
      Full Customize - Can fully modify your suspension system. *


OTHER           -----------------------------------
   VCD Controller - Lets you modify how your car handles.

   Weight Reduction - Strips car down, making it lighter and thusly faster.
      S1 - Strips a car down some
      S2 - Strips a car down more
      S3 - Fully Modifies a car so its as light as possible. *

   Increase Rigidity - Increases Suspension, makes the car feel 'solid'

   Rigidity Refresher Plan - Good for used cars, makes the body like new.
