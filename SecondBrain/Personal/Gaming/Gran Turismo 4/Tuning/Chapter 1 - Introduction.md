Hey there, this is a simple guide on how to tweak your car to 
maximize its performance in GT4. Back in the days of GT3 I wrote a tuning
presets FAQ which you can probably still find lingering around the internet.
Yes, i am Big D.  

	There will only be 3 major sections of the guide, 1 dealing with 
parts, 1 dealing with tuning the car specifically, and the last is a listing
of preset options to tune your car. Before we proceed any further, im going
to answer a few of the common questions you may have about the guide in
general.

                  (NOTE: PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE PROCEDING)
            (Double Note: This section was specifically designed to
            answer your common questions and i STILL am getting them,
            so please read this segment, especially #'s 5, 6, 7, and 8!)

1 - The 'Tuning Presets' are simply that; they are not car-defining and are
not supposed to be, i encourage you to mix them up and find an optimal 
formula for yourself to use. 

2 - You need to go to a shop specific to your car in order to buy parts to
upgrade it - if you cant find a shop go to the makers of the car - as they
sell the upgrades for it aswell. 

3 - Once you buy a part and want to tune your car, you need to go to a track
first. Once you get to the 'preview' window before you race, you can go to
the 'Settings' Option to see the tuning screen. *NOTE: you may also do this
in your garage by hitting start, it will send you to the settings screen*

4 - If a part of your car isn't tunable, then you probably havent bought the
proper materials, the 4th chapter assumes you have all the required materials
to tune your car. Some cars can't be equipped with specific parts, and if
thats the case you will have to work around it.

5 - For Chapter 4, the Gear Ratio/Transmission Setup, if i say "+10" it 
means to push -> 10 times on the controller, and if i say "-10" it means to 
push <- 10 times on the controller. So Start from the 'default' setting and
then go down the line, tweaking.
 
6 - For Chapter 4, a lot of the Settings will be listed in % form, so you can
Optimally choose the correct amount because multiple cars will have different
settings. The Bar Below is an accurate display of where to set the bar.
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       |   10%                      50%                    90%   |
       -----------------------------------------------------------
So if i say Brake Balance (F)10% (R)50% then that means i want you to set
the front at left-side of the bar and the rear at the direct middle of the
bar. In GT4 there are 5 lines, use those to gauge, they go from 0%, 25%, 50%,
75%, 100%

7 - A LOT of players are having trouble understand 6, so let me list a few
Examples. If i say i want your ride height at 0%, and your ride height ranges
from 50 to 100, then i want you to set your Ride Height at 50 (the lowest!)
If i say 25%, then i want you to set your ride height at 62. If i say 100%
then i want you to set it at (you guessed it!) 100. This is simple math guys. 

8 - A NEW Setup entirely for determining the final gear ratio setting which
is determined by the Horse Power Of your car. So make sure you know how
powerful your car is before you tweak that setting. 1-100 means your cars
HP is between 1 and 100. and the % is where you should set the Final.
