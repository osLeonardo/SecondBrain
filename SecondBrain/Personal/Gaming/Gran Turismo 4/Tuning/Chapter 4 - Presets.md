engine can probably handle an extremely low Final Gear Setting, between

OTHER NOTES
 - Make sure to take extra care when braking at hairpin turns, especially if
your travelling at high-end speeds.

 - If your speed is peaking out before you even hit the final gear, then your
engine isn't powerful enough to keep up with the gear settings, increase your
Final Gear Setting by 5-10% and you should be good.

 - Use your Nitro boost at the start of long straightaways to boost your
acceleration, once you get going let up and preserve it. 

 - This build suffers from acceleration problems, so avoid using it on tracks
with a lot of turns, where Acceleration is important. 

 - If you see a lot of sparks coming out of the bottom of your car constantly
(all the time) then increase your Ride Height by 5%

OTHER NOTES
 - This Build is excellent for not only taking turns, but accelerating out of 
them. you can really overtake cars using this method. 

 - Save your nitro's until you start reaching your speed cap, then use the 
nitro to push yourself further, covering up your weakness. 

 - If you see a lot of sparks coming out of the bottom of your car constantly
(all the time) then increase your Ride Height by 5%

OTHER NOTES

and even improve your max speed a little. 

 - There is a bit of emphasis on Oversteer so your car has a bit of a
'looser' feel and takes corners a bit better. 

 - If you see a lot of sparks coming out of the bottom of your car 
constantly (all the time) then increase your Ride Height by 5%

OTHER NOTES
 - A Huge Emphasis on oversteer, your car will, for the most part have a 
bit of drift on street roads, this will kill your back tires, so consider 
equipping Harder ones. 

 - makes your car turn almost more like an arcade game, just takes a 
bit more skill to turn, its easy to spin out so take some time and learn 
what your specific vehicle can handle. 

 - The Gear setup is for acceleration, because you will be sliding a lot,
you want to whip through the lower gear section.

OTHER NOTES
 - This is a very acceleration driven build, In Rally races you will
typically be all over the place so use the acceleration to your
advantage. 

 - The Car is geared for drifting with a very slight emphasis on
Oversteer, your springs are fairly loose so the dirt wont affect you
so much. 

 - If your having Trouble, Accelerate into those turns and pull hard
on the turn, you want to invoke oversteer, and as you start spinning,
turn the wheel the other way to 'hang-on' throughout the turn with
out spinning out.

 - This tuning style also has a 'rubberband' effect as far as turning
goes - Rally races have a lot of 'S' Style corners so you must turn
one direction and then another quickly, the build supports that style
of racing. 

 - USE THE HANDBRAKE while making very sharp turns to help pull your
rear out a bit more and finish that turn. Only begin handbraking AFTER
you've started the turn so it 'locks' your wheels in this position.

 - Be extra careful when taking rally turns at high speeds, it can be
dont but first and foremost you must learn to control your vehicle,
its absolutely critical to learn how to drift through turns, and slide
the rear end of your car out while turning, and THEN regain control
of the vehicle. 

 - If you spinout, sometimes you can go with it and do a complete
360' and recover almost perfectly (and look good doing it!)

 - I dont reccomend this tuning setting for non-rally races, but it
can be applied to snow-races aswell. It was initially created for
DIRT tracks, but the theory on snow is 'generally' the same. 

 - I was able to earn the Escudo with a LAND ROVER Range Stormer 
Concept '04, (Big Truck) with the Rover tuned to this setting. 
The Escudo is an extremely fast car that is earnable in one of the 
late Special Condition Hall Races. (Properly tuned, the Escudos front
end picks up like in the previous GT, not nearly as much though.)

OTHER NOTES
 - This Build is excellent for not only taking turns, Remember the technique
Of 'easy in, hard out' so you brake early and accelerate out of them. 

 - A lot of the emphasis of handling is placed on the front of the vehicle,
so i might suggest equipping Stickier Tires on the front, and a bit looser
Tires on back.

 - Also, never forget that the Stickier the tire, the better this setup will
work for you, but its only for a limited time, and the stickier your tires
are, the lower that time-frame is. 

 - You can use Nitro's to help boost your acceleration out of a corner, this
is tremendously effective at overtaking other vehicles.

 - If you see a lot of sparks coming out of the bottom of your car constantly
(all the time) then increase your Ride Height by 5%
