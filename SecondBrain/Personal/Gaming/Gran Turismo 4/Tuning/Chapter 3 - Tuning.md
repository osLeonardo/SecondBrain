DRIVETRAIN
   Transmission - Lets you modify the gear ratio's to tweak for high 
     acceleration or for high max-speed. This is one of the best things to
     play with for high performance vehicles. 

   Limited Slip
      Initial Torque - Increasing stabalizes your turning, decrease lets you
                       turn faster.
      Limited Slip Accel - Increasing this will let your car pull out of 
                           corners faster.
      Limited Slip Decel - Increasing this makes it harder for you turn. Dont


BRAKES
   Brake Controller
      Brake Balance - Set the rear high to create some spin while turning.
                      and set the front high to add more stability to your
                      turning. if they are set to the same #, the change is
                      minor.


TURBO 
   Nitrous
      Duration <-> Speed - Set this higher to get more of an initial boost.
      set lower to have it last longer throughout the race.


SUSPENSION
   Suspension
      Spring Rate - General tension of the springs in general.
      Ride Height - Allows modification of the chassis height.
      Shock Absorbers - Absorbs The Shock when hitting a bump, the returns
                        to normal, preventing speed loss/bouncing.
      Shock (Bound) - Deals with how tense the springs are, the less
                      bouncy/curvy the track is, the higher you want this.
      Shock (Rebound) - Deals with how tense the springs are, the less
                        bouncy/curvy the track is, the higher you want this.
      Camber Angle - Tweaks how far the wheel is from the car
      Toe Angle - Tweaks the angle of the wheel. 
      Stabalizers - Acts as a helper in stabalizing the car in turns.


OTHER 
   Driving Aids
      ASM (Over) - The higher the value, the more it prevents sliding, but
                   also makes it harder to steer
      ASM (Under) - The higher the value, the easier it is to turn the car,
                    but also makes it easier to spin-out.
      TCS Controller - The higher the value of the TCS, the more stable your
                       car, but it will accelerate less, and become sluggish.
                       A low value will make it spin more.
   Downforce
      Downforce - applies wind pressure that will stabilize/destabilize the
                  car at high-end speeds. 

   AYC Controller (havent played with yet)

   Variable Center Diff. - Distributes Power to seperate wheels changing the
                           behavior of the car (Usually for AWD)

   Weight Balance
      Ballast Weight - Tweaks the general weight of the ballast 
      Front/Rear Balance - Adjusts where the ballast is, setting this to a
                           negative level will make it easier to corner, but
                           more likely to spin out, and setting this to a
                           high level will have the opposite effect.
